-- Installation Guide
Step 1: Installing Images to Inventory.
- Open the 'install me' folder, click on the 'Inventory Images'
- Copy or drag all of the images into your inventory images folder. 

Step 2: Adding the items to your Inventory
- If you are NOT on Ox Inventory, simply execute the 'items-limit' or 'items-weight' .sql files into your SQL
- If you are on Ox Inventory, simply execute the 'items-weight.sql' file, then restart the server, Ox Inventory will automatically detect the items and add it into its registry.

Step 3: Configuring the Script
- The script is extremely easy to configure, I recommend adjusting the following:
: Configure the Job to be enabled and sell the scammer role as a job on Tebex (this will make you lots of money, I suggest you do this)
: Configure all the sales location to your own preference.
: Adjust the reward for all products to whatever you feel is a good reward for the player to sell.
: I suggest enabling the 'Failure' system so players don't have an infinite money income and will experience some failure in selling products.

OPTIONAL: Setting up the police alert system
We currently support the following dispatch system:
- rCore_dispatch [https://store.rcore.cz/package/5789351]
- qs-dispatch [https://www.quasar-store.com/package/5695149]
- cd-dispatch [https://codesign.pro/product/4206357]
- lb-tablet [https://lbscripts.com/tablet]

If you would like to configure the way how alerts are sent, you can open the 'alert.lua' file in [source\server\alert.lua]
